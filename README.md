# utterly-unorganized-latex-code


latex code from my first year of engineering. 


most of this code is mine. some stuff is a hodgpotch of random solutions i found on the internet. Some of it was thrown together with chatGPT and a fuckton of tweaking

i am an incredibley unorganized and messy coder. I bruteforce things till they work. I tend to have no idea what I am doing half the time lol.

sorry if you have issues understanding or the code or rendering it. I don't have time to make it look pretty. Feel free to do so if you want to



I wasn't gonna upload any of this because I am protective over my work. I spent enormous amounts of time learning LaTex
and perfecting my designs. However, due to popular demand, I have caved. 

I won't give out my calculus notes. I plan on selling those, sorry (there the purple ones if you come from reddit)









Enjoy!
